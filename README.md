# captionsParsing

This project is focused on improving machine learning-generated captions by comparing them with human-generated captions. The system calculates word inaccuracy scores to measure and evaluate the quality of ML-generated captions against human benchmarks, aiming to make automated captioning as accurate and natural as human-created captions.
